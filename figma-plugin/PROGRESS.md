- Extract Referenced Components (Pending)
- Structure and Validate Extracted Data (Pending)

### Task 5: Export Frame Screenshot as PNG (Pending)

## Current Implementation Details

The Figma plugin currently:

1. Successfully extracts the complete node hierarchy from selected frames
2. Properly extracts style references including:
   - Fill styles
   - Text styles
   - Stroke styles
   - Effect styles
   - Grid styles
3. Identifies component instances and their references
4. Displays the extracted JSON in the UI 
5. Offers download capability for the extracted data
6. Includes a "Send to Server" feature to transmit data to the backend API

## Next Steps

1. Complete Task 4 by implementing:
   - Variable extraction (subtask 4.3)
   - Component reference extraction (subtask 4.4)
   - Data structure validation (subtask 4.5)

2. Begin Task 5 (Export Frame Screenshot as PNG):
   - Implement PNG export logic
   - Handle resolution and scale settings

3. Improve server integration:
   - Enhance error handling for server communication
   - Add progress indication for server processing

## Technical Improvements Needed

1. Better error reporting for style reference extraction failures
2. Performance optimization for large frame hierarchies
3. Caching mechanism for repeated style lookups
4. Automatic retry for server communication failures

## Challenges Encountered & Solutions

1. **Plugin Closing Too Quickly:** Initially, the plugin would close immediately after extraction, not giving users time to see or download the extracted JSON. Solution: Modified the plugin to stay open until explicitly closed by the user.

2. **Style Reference Resolution:** Some style references were difficult to resolve due to unavailable API methods. Solution: Implemented robust error handling and fallbacks for missing style information.

3. **TaskMaster Integration:** Encountered difficulties with TaskMaster's command line interface. Solution: Created manual tracking through this progress report.
